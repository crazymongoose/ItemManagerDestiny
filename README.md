# Item Manager Destiny
Item Manager Destiny (IMD) lets players the game [Destiny](http://destinythegame.com/) to easily move items between their Guardians and the Vault. The goals of IMD is to let players equip their guardians quickly.  It does this by removing manual steps needed when transfering items and with our Loadouts feature.  

Loadouts give players the ability to define sets of items that they want on their Guardians.  When a loadout is selected, IMD will move the items referenced by the Loadout to a Guardian.  IF the item was equipped by another guardian, the Loadouts feature will replace that item with a similar item, if possible, to allow the Loadout referenced item to be transfered.  With a single click of a button, you can have a PVP, PVE, or Raid-ready guardian.

IMD is based on the same services used by the Destiny Companion app to move and equip items. IMD will never ask for your credentials to [Bungie.net](http;//bungie.net).  Once logged into Bungie.net, IMD will be able to see your Guardians inventory and Vault.  Once you logout of Bungie, IMD will no longer have access to your Guardians or Vault.  

IMD will not be able to dismantle any of your items.
